The idea itself is a roguelike card game, sort of like Slay The Spire or Deepest Chamber. However I have some ideas for the mechanics that would make it play quite differently.

Firstly, there's three types of encounter: Combat, Social or Exploration.

Combat could be "Some brigands accost you", Social could be "A farmer asks for help with his crops" and Exploration could be "You come across some historic ruins". Each type of encounter would have a matching card type. For instance "Firebolt" would be a combat card, "Charm" would be a social card, and "Torch" would be an exploration card.

The trick comes that you can use any card type in any situation. For example "Charm" could be used to remove one of the brigands from the fight, "Torch" could be used to reveal invisible enemies; "Firebolt" could be used to briefly illuminate the dark in the historic ruins, or it could be used to intimidate the farmer into giving you his goods.

Something that I'd like to add in as well is an "overcharge" mechanic to the cards, so you could cast three firebolts for all three energy for 12 damage, or you could cast 1 overcharged firebolt for 1 energy by discarding the other two firebolts, this would do 8 damage and apply Burn 2 or something.


I understand that adding *both* these mechanics might be a bit tight for a 30 day game jam so I would be happy to do just one or the other.
