## Deckbuilding

The core mechanic behind this game will be deck building. The player (mage) starts with a deck of 12 cards and draws 4 each round, with a hand limit imposed.

A deck will contain several copies of the same card, and these can be cast either individually or can be used to boost other copies of the same card.

Cards generally cost one action point to cast, however upcasting a currently played card has no additional cost other than discarding the cards.

When a card is played, it is discarded and the cost of the card is subtracted from the mage's action points.

  

## Cards

These cards will represent spells that the mage can cast and fall into three categories: Combat, Exploration and Social. These categories match with the three types of encounters.

The mage is encouraged to build a deck with a variety of cards in it as the three kinds of encounters all come up fairly frequently. The drawback to this is the mage can draw all three kinds of cards in any situation.

  

### Combat Cards

Tend towards dealing damage or providing defence.

  

### Exploration Cards

Tend towards

  

### Social Cards

  
  

## Turn Structure

A turn is divided into the following steps:

  

### 1 - Upkeep Step

- Trigger "start of turn" status effects

- Decrease status durations by 1.

- Refresh Action Points

- Draw 4 cards

  

### 2 - Main Step

- Mage casts cards from hand

    1. Mage chooses card to cast

    2. Mage chooses target

    3. Mage gets choice to upcast card by discarding identical cards

    4. Card effects get amplified by the number of cards discarded to upcast

    5. Card effects apply to target

    6. Initial card is discarded

  

### 3 - End Step

- Trigger "End of turn" status effects

- If number of cards in hand is larger than hand limit, discard down to hand limit

  

### 4 - Encounter Step

- The encounter acts as appropriate:

    - Combat encounters - Enemy chooses its action out of attack, defend or status. It then applies the effects.

    - Social encounters - Opponent reacts to the mage as appropriate

    - Exploration Encounters - Encounter progresses as affected by the mage

  

## Encounter win conditions:

Combat encounters: All enemies are either dead or charmed

Social encounters: Bit more tricky, some opponents need to be scared,  others need to be placated. Varies from scenario to scenario

Exploration encounters: Generally the mage wins by escaping unharmed or by discovering something.

# Overcharge
Whenever a card is cast, if the player has additional copies in their hand, they may optionally discard these additional copies to boost the effect of the played card.

### Targeted effects

4. charm 4 targets (Auto ends combat)

### AOE effects
